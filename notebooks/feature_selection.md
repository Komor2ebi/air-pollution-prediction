    "\n",
    "1. ***Methane (CH4) itself*** is not directly related to PM2.5 concentrations, as it does not directly contribute to particulate matter levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "    -> drop columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ***Sulfur dioxide (SO2)*** is closely related to PM2.5. SO2 is a significant precursor to sulfate aerosols, which are a major component of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the atmosphere. Here's how the relationship works:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Chemical Transformations: When SO2 is emitted into the atmosphere, it can undergo various chemical reactions, particularly with hydroxyl radicals. This transformation leads to the formation of sulfuric acid (H2SO4), which can further react or nucleate to form sulfate particles.\n",
    "    Secondary Particulate Formation: These sulfate particles contribute to secondary particulate matter, significantly influencing the concentration of PM2.5. This process is especially relevant in urban areas and regions with high fossil fuel combustion rates, where SO2 emissions are substantial.\n",
    "    Environmental and Health Impact: The sulfate component of PM2.5 is known for its ability to degrade air quality and cause health problems, including respiratory and cardiovascular issues.\n",
    "    Regulation and Control: Due to its role in forming PM2.5, controlling SO2 emissions is a critical strategy for reducing overall particulate matter levels and improving air quality.\n",
    "    Understanding the link between SO2 and PM2.5 is crucial for environmental policy and implementing effective air quality management strategies​ (MDPI)​.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> keep columns\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ***Aerosols*** are closely related to PM2.5. In the context of air pollution, \"aerosol\" refers to the suspension of fine solid particles or liquid droplets in air or another gas. These can include a wide range of particles, such as dust, pollen, soot, smoke, and liquid droplets, which are small enough to be suspended in the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "    PM2.5 specifically refers to particulate matter that has a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers. These fine particles are a subset of aerosols and are significant from both environmental and health perspectives because they can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, causing various health issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Aerosols can be generated from both natural sources, such as volcanic eruptions and forest fires, and human-made sources, such as vehicle emissions and industrial processes. The study and management of aerosols, particularly PM2.5, are crucial for air quality monitoring and public health protection.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> keep columns\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ***Cloud characteristics*** such as cloud fraction, height, pressure at the base and top, optical depth, and surface albedo can influence PM2.5 levels, although often indirectly. Here’s how these factors might play a role:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Cloud Fraction and Optical Depth**: These determine the amount of sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface, which can affect photochemical reactions in the atmosphere. These reactions are crucial for the formation of secondary pollutants that contribute to PM2.5. For instance, lower sunlight due to high cloud cover can reduce the rate of photochemical smog formation, potentially lowering PM2.5 levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Cloud Height and Pressure**: The height and pressure of clouds can influence atmospheric circulation and weather patterns, which in turn affect air pollution dispersion. Higher clouds and different pressure levels can lead to changes in wind patterns, possibly dispersing or concentrating pollutants like PM2.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Surface Albedo**: This refers to the Earth's surface ability to reflect sunlight. Surfaces with high albedo (like those covered with snow or light-colored materials) reflect more solar radiation, which can reduce ground-level temperatures and affect thermal circulations. These changes can impact how pollutants are mixed and dispersed in the lower atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **Clouds and Precipitation**: Clouds are also related to precipitation processes. Precipitation can remove pollutants from the atmosphere, a process known as wet deposition. When particulate matter like PM2.5 is washed out of the atmosphere by rain or snow, it leads to temporary improvements in air quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In summary, while clouds don't directly emit or absorb PM2.5, their presence and characteristics can significantly alter meteorological conditions, thereby influencing the levels and distribution of particulate matter indirectly through changes in sunlight exposure, weather patterns, and precipitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> keep columns\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ***Formaldehyde (HCHO)*** is related to PM2.5 primarily through secondary formation processes in the atmosphere. Formaldehyde is a volatile organic compound (VOC) that can act as a precursor to secondary organic aerosols (SOAs), which are a component of PM2.5. Here’s how this relationship works:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Chemical Reactions**: Formaldehyde in the atmosphere can undergo photochemical reactions driven by sunlight. These reactions can produce radicals and other compounds that further react to form secondary organic aerosols.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Contribution to PM2.5**: The SOAs formed from formaldehyde and other VOCs contribute to the overall mass of PM2.5 in the atmosphere. These aerosols can be significant, especially in urban and industrial areas with high levels of VOC emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Air Quality Impact**: Because formaldehyde is involved in the formation of particulate matter, controlling VOC emissions (including formaldehyde) is important for managing PM2.5 levels and improving air quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The link between HCHO and PM2.5 underscores the complexity of air pollution chemistry and the importance of monitoring a wide range of pollutants to effectively manage and mitigate air quality issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> keep columns\n",
    "\n",
    "6. ***Carbon monoxide (CO)*** is not a direct component of PM2.5, but it is often correlated with PM2.5 concentrations in the atmosphere, primarily due to shared sources. Here’s how CO is related to PM2.5:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Common Sources**: Both CO and PM2.5 are often emitted from the same sources, such as motor vehicles, biomass burning, and industrial processes. This commonality means that areas with high CO levels often also have high PM2.5 levels due to simultaneous emissions of various pollutants.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Indicator of Combustion Efficiency**: CO is a product of incomplete combustion. High levels of CO can indicate poor combustion efficiency, which is also likely to produce higher amounts of particulate matter, including PM2.5. For example, inefficient fuel burning in engines or heaters can release both CO and a variety of particulate pollutants.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Atmospheric Chemistry**: While CO does not directly form PM2.5, it participates in atmospheric chemical reactions that can influence the levels of other pollutants that do form PM2.5. For instance, CO can react in the atmosphere to form secondary pollutants that contribute to the overall particulate load.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **Air Quality Management**: Because of the correlation between the sources of CO and PM2.5, measures to reduce CO emissions (such as improving fuel combustion efficiency or upgrading vehicle emission standards) can also lead to reductions in PM2.5 concentrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Thus, while CO is not a direct precursor or component of PM2.5, its presence is associated with conditions that can lead to increased levels of particulate matter. Monitoring CO levels can help in assessing combustion-related pollution and formulating strategies to control overall air pollution, including PM2.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> keep columns\n",
    "\n",
    "7. ***Ozone (O3)*** is not directly a component of PM2.5, but it is related to particulate matter formation through atmospheric chemistry interactions. Here’s how ozone is connected to PM2.5:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Secondary Organic Aerosols (SOAs)**: Ozone plays a crucial role in the formation of secondary organic aerosols. Ozone can react with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from sources such as vehicles, industrial processes, and vegetation. These reactions often occur in the presence of sunlight and lead to the formation of new particulate matter, contributing to PM2.5 levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Photochemical Smog**: Ozone is a major component of photochemical smog, which includes a mixture of air pollutants including particulate matter. The same conditions that favor the formation of ozone (such as sunny, warm days) also promote the formation of PM2.5 from precursor gases like VOCs and nitrogen oxides (NOx).\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Oxidizing Capacity**: Ozone has strong oxidizing properties, which can transform primary emissions into more reactive species that can then nucleate or condense to form particulate matter. This process can transform less harmful emissions into particles small enough to be classified as PM2.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **Indicator of Air Quality**: Elevated levels of ozone and PM2.5 often occur together under certain meteorological conditions, particularly in urban environments. Thus, high ozone days can often also be high PM2.5 days, especially during periods of stagnant air that prevent the dispersion of pollutants.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In summary, while ozone itself does not make up PM2.5, it influences the atmospheric processes that lead to the formation of PM2.5. Managing ozone levels, especially in urban areas, is therefore important not only for controlling ozone itself but also for managing levels of fine particulate matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> keep columns\n",
    "\n",
    "8. ***Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)*** is related to PM2.5, primarily through its role in the formation of secondary particulate matter. Here’s how NO2 contributes to PM2.5 levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Formation of Nitrate Aerosols**: NO2 reacts with atmospheric compounds to form nitrate aerosols, which are a significant component of PM2.5. This reaction typically occurs with ammonia (NH3) to produce particulate nitrates, which increase the concentration of fine particulate matter in the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Photochemical Reactions**: NO2 plays a crucial role in photochemical reactions that produce ozone and other photochemical oxidants. These oxidants can further react with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other precursors to form secondary organic aerosols (SOAs), contributing to PM2.5 levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Urban Air Pollution**: In urban environments, where NO2 emissions are high due to traffic and industrial activities, the contribution of NO2 to PM2.5 formation is particularly significant. The density of emission sources accelerates the formation of both nitrate aerosols and SOAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **Indicator of Combustion Sources**: Similar to carbon monoxide (CO), NO2 is often emitted from combustion sources such as vehicles and power plants. High levels of NO2 can indicate significant combustion-related pollution, which often corresponds with increased PM2.5 from various combustion byproducts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Managing NO2 emissions is important for controlling PM2.5 levels, especially in urban areas where exposure to NO2 and fine particulates can pose significant health risks. Reducing NO2 emissions from vehicles and industrial sources is crucial for improving air quality and reducing particulate matter pollution.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> keep columns\n",
    "\n",
    "9. ***Wind*** is significantly related to PM2.5 levels, primarily through its role in the dispersion and transport of these fine particles. Here’s how wind impacts PM2.5:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Dispersion of Particles**: Wind helps to disperse air pollutants, including PM2.5. Higher wind speeds can dilute concentrations of particulate matter by spreading them over a wider area, potentially reducing the pollutant levels in a specific locale while distributing these particles over a larger region.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Transport of Pollutants**: Wind can carry PM2.5 from their sources to distant locations. This means that areas downwind of major pollution sources (like industrial areas, urban centers, or areas with heavy traffic) can experience elevated PM2.5 levels due to wind transport.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Influence on Air Quality**: Wind direction and speed are critical factors in determining daily air quality. For example, winds blowing from industrial zones towards residential areas can lead to higher exposure to PM2.5 for populations in those residential areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **Interaction with Weather Patterns**: Wind is also influenced by broader weather patterns and geographical features. For instance, mountainous regions can experience \"channeling\" effects that may concentrate or disperse air pollutants differently, affecting PM2.5 concentrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. **Impact on Emission Sources**: In situations where wind influences the operation of pollution sources (such as in open mining, construction sites, or agriculture), it can increase the generation of particulate matter by stirring up dust and other particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In air quality modeling and environmental monitoring, understanding the patterns of wind in a region is crucial for predicting PM2.5 levels and managing pollution control strategies effectively. Wind data is often used alongside other meteorological factors to develop accurate forecasts and public health advisories regarding air quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> keep columns\n",
    "\n",
    "10. ***Temperature*** is related to PM2.5 levels through several mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Chemical Reaction Rates**: Higher temperatures can increase the rate of chemical reactions in the atmosphere that lead to the formation of secondary particulate matter. For example, higher temperatures accelerate the photochemical reactions involving volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which form secondary organic aerosols and nitrate aerosols, respectively, contributing to PM2.5 levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Atmospheric Stability**: Temperature influences the stability of the atmosphere. Warmer temperatures tend to increase atmospheric instability, which can enhance the vertical mixing of pollutants and disperse air pollutants, including PM2.5. Conversely, lower temperatures, especially during night or winter, can lead to temperature inversions that trap pollutants close to the ground, increasing PM2.5 concentrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Emission Sources**: Temperature can affect emissions from various sources. For instance, residential heating demand increases during colder temperatures, potentially increasing emissions of PM2.5 from combustion processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **Volatility of Organic Compounds**: Temperature changes affect the volatility of organic compounds. Higher temperatures can increase the volatility, enhancing the formation of secondary organic aerosols as more vapors are available to participate in atmospheric reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    These relationships highlight the complex interplay between meteorological conditions and air quality, making temperature a critical factor in modeling and managing PM2.5 pollution.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> keep columns\n",
    "\n",
    "11. ***Yumidity*** is related to PM2.5 concentrations in the atmosphere through various mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Particle Growth**: High humidity levels can lead to the growth of particulate matter. Water vapor condenses on particles, causing them to grow in size and mass. This can increase the PM2.5 concentration as smaller particles grow to become part of the PM2.5 classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Chemical Reactions**: Humidity can also influence the chemical reactions that form secondary particles, such as sulfates and nitrates. For example, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) can react with water vapor to form these secondary particulate matters, which are components of PM2.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Hygroscopic Properties**: Many particles in the PM2.5 category are hygroscopic, meaning they can absorb moisture from the air. This absorption can change the chemical composition and physical properties of the particles, potentially making them more hazardous or altering their ability to be filtered by the respiratory system.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **Agglomeration**: Higher humidity can enhance the agglomeration of particles, where smaller particles stick together to form larger particles. While this might reduce the number of particles classified as PM2.5 by mass, it can also make them more likely to deposit in the respiratory tract.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Understanding the role of humidity in PM2.5 dynamics is crucial for accurate air quality forecasting and health risk assessment, especially in regions with high humidity levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> keep columns\n",
    "\n",
    "12. ***The angles*** in the features refer to geographical and/or directional measurements related to the data, such as the angles of wind direction, satellite data acquisition angles, or other related metrics. Angles can be important in air quality modeling if they relate to how pollutants disperse or how satellite observations are made relative to the Earth's surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, wind direction, which could be represented by angles, is crucial for understanding how air pollutants travel and disperse across different areas. Similarly, satellite observation angles might affect the accuracy and relevance of the measurements for specific locations, especially in complex urban geometries where building shadows or reflections might influence sensor readings.\n",

    "To prevent any alteration of the dataset through the creation of synthetic data, we have decided to retain the NaN values in the columns we preserve.\n",
    "\n",
